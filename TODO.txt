client				p2p-server			client

hello server,
connect me to anyone.
I don't care how.

* list of connected players
  - some ID
  - the entity they are controlling
* let me send messages.

I define 3 types:
1 TEXT
2 GAME_INPUT
3 MAP

_net.h
enum message_type
{
	TEXT = 0,
        GAME_INPUT,
        MAP
}

struct message
{
	enum message_type type;
}

struct p2p p2p;
u8 *data;
size_t len;
while (p2p_net_service (&p2p, data, len))
{
  switch (p2p.event.type)
  {
    case P2P_CONNECT: break;
    case P2P_RECEIVE:
	// process message
        assert (len >= sizeof (struct message));
        struct message *msg = (struct messge *) data;
	switch (msg->type)
        {
            case TEXT:
            case GAME_INPUT:
            case MAP:
        }
    case P2P_DISCONNECT: break;
}

* as a game client, I want to be able to dynamically turn on/off server mode to
let players join me
- turn on server mode
    - connect to MMServer
    - register self as server
    - accept incoming clients
* as a game client, I want to join any available games being hosted
* as a game client, I want to select a hosted game from a list and join it
